# About this project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project is a MERN project using all the knowledge acquire during Tech Ed course:

- MongoDb to stock the trips of the users
- Express Server to recover the informations from the database and from multiple external API
- React client to show informations to the user

The idea was to create a dashboard where we can have all the informations about our incoming trips at the
same place, to be able to enjoy our trips without stress, and without having to check multiple websites.
